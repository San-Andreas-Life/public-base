# San Andreas Life Thirdeye
San Andreas Life Thirdeye is a resource that was build for the [San Andreas Life](https://salroleplay.net/pages/discord) FiveM Community. <br>
Our Developers put alot of attention in this script to make sure all would work right. <br>
With these resources we where hoping to create our own custom framework just like `esx`, `vrp`, `qbcore` etc! <br>
<br>

# Resources
Because of the amount of resources that the prefix `TE` currently use we decided it might be best to either start a wiki. <br>
The wiki will allow you to find better and faster information on the resources. With this we hope that the people using our resources will gian more knowledge. <br>
Keep in mind that these resources where made for the `San Andreas Life` server and that they are configured to match permissions in `San Andreas Life` <br>
You're free to customize them as you wish but for more info on that read the disclaimer!
