# DISCLAIMER
This project is UNLICENSED. This repository just allows us to submit publis issues / data so that all members may see it. This repository will NEVER show full code but only very sninppets of what your developers are un-aware about or code that should be functioning correctly but isn't.

Requesting backend code will get your replies, topics and even discord status removed.
